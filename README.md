# Cross-Subject-Emotion-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-on-SEED-IV-Dataset
In this study, we explore the use of transfer learning techniques for cross-subject emotion classification on the SEED-IV dataset, a subset of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Emotion EEG dataset. We implement and compare two transfer learning approaches: domain adaptation using gradient reversal and feature augmentation. We conduct leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of both methods. The results indicate that domain adaptation using gradient reversal outperforms feature augmentation, with an average accuracy of 57.96% compared to 34.61%.
